- Users can search locations by tags and sort them based on ratings
- Users are provided with recommendations of locations based on their preferences (rating history) 


## Technology Stack
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
    - JavaScript library for frontend development
- [Material UI](https://mui.com)
    - React library for designing and developing UIs
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
    - Open-source JavaScript library for rendering maps
- [GeoJSON](http://geojson.io/)
    - Special JSON format used for storing geospatial data
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview)
    - For extra features like 360¬∞ views
    - Geocoding
        - To convert common spatial search parameters (such as addresses) to usable coordinates

## Technical Challenges
1. Figuring out how to visiually mark locations on map and display those markers to users
2. Learning the Google Maps API and integrating it into our app with our other technologies
3. Developing an effective system for user recommendations based user preference 
4. Getting familiarized with geo-databases and how to use them in conjunction with our other technologies (namely Mapbox)
5. Deploying the final application
